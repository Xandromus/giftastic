A gif generator designed to display 10 random gifs associated with one of 10 characters from the FOX/NETFLIX show Arrested Development. 50 gifs are pulled from the Giphy API using an AJAX GET request when the user clicks on the button associated with the character, and then 10 random gifs are displayed. For each character's button that's clicked, the gifs disappear and the new character's gifs appear in their place.

Additional characters can be added by pushing the ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER button, and they retain the same functionality as the original character buttons.

The gif area can be cleared at any point by using the CLEAR ALL GIFS button, and the user can return to the original list of 10 characters by pusing the START OVER button to reload the page.

The theme music plays once after the user clicks the first character button.
